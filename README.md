# Converter Application

This application was made for a test assignment and build on the React. I used the following nmp packages:

-   react-router
-   react-router-dom
-   axios
-   sass

## Functionality

A converter and a currency table have been implemented in the app. All data comes from a public API https://cdn.cur.su/api/latest.json. The converter is able to convert one currency to another. You can swap the currencies to be exchanged, also on the Exchange Rates page you can see the current exchange rates, which come from the server.

## How do I start the application?

To run the application you must use `npm i` and `npm start`
